/**
 * Associate Renewal — schema (TS structure side).
 *
 * Four-field identity form (firstName, lastName, email, year). Year is
 * pre-filled from the URL (or the current year) and validated as an
 * integer in [2024, 2100].
 *
 * `appendRenewal` takes named args, so the API route passes
 * `result.values` straight through after merging managed cells
 * (renewalId, tier, phone, pdEntries, amountCents, currency, etc.).
 * `toRow` is reserved for positional adapters (Phase C — `createApplicantRow`'s
 * 31 positional args).
 *
 * Storage column map (form-derived cells only):
 *   C renewal_year, D first_name, E last_name, F email
 *   (A renewal_id, B tier, G phone, H pd_entries, I amount_paid_cents,
 *    J currency, K payment_status, L stripe_session, M created_at,
 *    N paid_at are managed cells — written by the API route + Stripe
 *    webhook, not by this schema.)
