 * pricing, sheet-logging and email modules. Centralised here so any instance
 * can change them in one place.
 *
 * See docs/CUSTOMIZE.md → "Localisation constants" before deploying for a
 * different region/currency. Note that Stripe Prices must also be created in
 * the matching currency, or the currency guard in stripe-products.ts will
 * reject them and /api/health will report "degraded".
