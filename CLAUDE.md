## Key Functions (upload-sheet.ts)

- `createApplicantRow(...47 params...)` — creates row with all form fields
- `updateApplicantFormData(applicantId, data)` — partial update of form fields
- `validateCompletion(applicantId)` — returns true only when all form fields filled AND all 6 required doc categories have ≥1 file
- `getApplicantByToken(token)` — returns `ApplicantInfo` with all 47 columns
- `getUploadStatus(applicantId)` — returns `UploadStatus` with doc counts

---

## Multi-File Upload (Drive Files Sheet)

- One row **per uploaded file** (not per applicant)
- `deleted = "TRUE"` for soft deletes
- File path in Drive: `/applications/{applicant_id}/documents/{doc_type}/{file_id}.{ext}`
- `file_id` is a random UUID — original filename stored only in Drive Files sheet

**File limits:**
- Max 10MB per file
- Allowed types: PDF, JPEG, PNG, GIF, DOC, DOCX

## Backwards Compatibility

Existing applicants (pre-Phase 2) have blank new columns — acceptable.
Resume links continue to work.
