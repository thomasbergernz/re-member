# Migration map — column letters per form

For ops continuity during the schema-driven form migration (Phase A → E). Use this when triaging "where does this form's data land in the sheet?" tickets.

> **Tier naming:** the platform renamed professional→**advanced** and associate→**basic** (Phase K/M). New Renewals rows store `tier` as `"adv"` / `"basic"`; historical rows still carry the legacy `"pm"` / `"am"` values, which `renewal-sheet.ts`'s `legacyTierMap` maps on read. Both generations of rows resolve correctly.

## Renewals sheet (14 columns, shared)

Form-derived cells written by `appendRenewal`:

| Col | Field | Basic | Advanced | PD-log |
|-----|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| A | `renewal_id` | managed | managed | n/a (existing row updated) |
| B | `tier` | managed (`"basic"`, legacy `"am"`) | managed (`"adv"`, legacy `"pm"`) | n/a |
| C | `renewal_year` | schema (year) | schema (year) | n/a |
| D | `first_name` | schema (firstName) | schema (firstName) | n/a |
| E | `last_name` | schema (lastName) | schema (lastName) | n/a |
| F | `email` | schema (email) | schema (email) | n/a |
| G | `phone` | n/a (Basic has no phone) | schema (phone) | n/a |
| H | `pd_entries` | managed (`[]`) | schema (pdEntries, JSON) | schema (pdEntries, JSON) |
| I | `amount_paid_cents` | managed | managed | managed |
| J | `currency` | managed | managed | managed |
| K | `payment_status` | managed | managed | managed |
| L | `stripe_session` | managed (backfilled from webhook) | managed | managed |
| M | `created_at` | managed | managed | managed |
| N | `paid_at` | managed (set by webhook) | managed | managed |

"Managed" cells stay in the API route + Stripe webhook — the schema owns only the form-derived cells.

## Advanced Applications sheet (48 columns)

Form-derived cells (32 of 48) written by `createApplicantRow` / `updateApplicantFormData`. Managed cells (16 of 48): `A applicant_id`, `AH email_hash`, `AI-AO doc counts`, `AP complete`, `AQ stripe_session`, `AR paid`, `AS created_at`, `AT paid_at`, `AU email_verified`, `AF declaration_signed_at`.

`AV signature` — the schema-driven signature field: a typed full name OR a Drive link to a drawn PNG. Written on autosave via `updateApplicantFormData`, not embedded in the review Google Doc.

See `advancedApply.columnMap` for the field → column mapping (32 entries).

## Basic Applications sheet (16 columns)

Form-derived cells (13 of 16) written by `appendBasicApplication`. Managed cells (3 of 16): `A submitted_at`, `B application_id`, `P checkout_status`.

See `basicApply.columnMap` for the field → column mapping (13 entries).
