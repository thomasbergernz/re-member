# Re:Member Notifications

> When and how Re:Member sends notifications to applicants and members.

---

## Currently Implemented

### 1. Resume Link Email

**Trigger:** New Professional Membership application started (`POST /api/professional/apply`)

**Conditions:**
- Only on **new** applicant creation (not on subsequent form updates/resumes)
- Applicant must have provided an email address

**Template:** `sendResumeLink(toEmail, fullName, resumeLink, applicantId?)` in `src/lib/email-sender.ts`

```
Subject: Your Re:Member Professional Membership Application

Dear {fullName},

Thank you for starting your Professional Membership application with Re:Member.

To continue your application, please click the link below:
{resumeLink}

This link will allow you to upload your required documents and complete your application.

If you did not start this application, please ignore this email.

Best regards,
Re:Member
```

**Delivery:** Non-blocking — failures are logged but do not fail the application submission.

**Audit:** Resume link emails are logged to the `Email log` sheet.

## Planned / Not Yet Implemented

The following notifications are described in the UI but **not yet implemented**:

| Notification | UI Copy | Trigger Location | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Document verification confirmation | "You will receive confirmation once your documents have been verified" | `success-upload.astro` | Not implemented |
| Membership activation confirmation | "You will receive confirmation once your membership has been activated" | `associate-membership.astro` | Not implemented |
| Payment receipt | — | — | **Stripe handles it** — Re:Member passes `receipt_email` in the Checkout Session API call, which overrides Dashboard automatic receipt settings. Stripe sends its own branded receipt directly to that address. |
| Subscription renewal reminder | — | — | Not implemented |
| Application review completion | — | — | Not implemented |

### 2. Payment Confirmation (Applicant Email)

**Trigger:** `checkout.session.completed` webhook event for professional membership

**To:** Applicant's email address (from sheet)

**Template:** `sendProfessionalConfirmation(toEmail, fullName, applicantId?)` in `src/lib/email-sender.ts`

```
Subject: Your Re:Member Professional Membership Application

Dear {fullName},

Thank you for your application to become a Professional Member of Re:Member. We will process your application and get back to you as soon as we can.

We look forward to seeing you soon.

Kia ora,
Re:Member Committee
```

**Delivery:** Non-blocking — failures are logged but do not fail webhook processing.

**Audit:** Confirmation email sends are logged to the `Email log` sheet (columns: timestamp, to, subject, template, applicantId, result, error).

---

### 3. Internal Application Notification (Re:Member Membership Team)

**Trigger:** After `createApplicationReviewDoc()` completes successfully for professional membership

**To:** `membership@example.com` (hardcoded)

**Template:** `sendProfessionalApplicationNotification(toEmail, applicantName, docUrl, applicantId?)` in `src/lib/email-sender.ts`

```
Subject: New Professional Membership Application — {applicantName}

A new professional membership application has been received and the review document is ready.

Applicant: {applicantName}
Review document: {docUrl}

Please log in to review the application and continue the membership process.

Re:Member
```

**Delivery:** Non-blocking — failures are logged but do not fail webhook processing.

**Audit:** Notification emails are logged to the `Email log` sheet.

---

### 4. Associate Membership Confirmation (Applicant Email)

**Trigger:** After `createAssociateApplicationReviewDoc()` completes for associate membership

**To:** Applicant's email address

**Reply-To:** `membership@example.com`

**Template:** `sendAssociateConfirmation(toEmail, fullName, listOnPage, associateApplicationId?)` in `src/lib/email-sender.ts`

```
Subject: Welcome to Re:Member — Associate Membership Confirmed

Welcome to Re:Member ☺

Dear {fullName},

We would like to officially welcome you on board [Your Organisation Name] as an
Associate Member. We are delighted you are joining us in this role, and look
forward to supporting you in your work.

{listOnPage ? "You have requested to be listed on our Associate Member list on
our website — we will process that shortly." : "You have not requested to be
listed at this time. If you would like to be added in future, please email us
at membership@example.com."}

[Resources, Meetings, Networking sections...]

Questions? Email us at membership@example.com — we would love your feedback
and any ideas you have to support you in your work.

Again, welcome on board ☺

Warm regards,
Re:Member Committee
```

**Delivery:** Non-blocking — fires after Google Doc creation succeeds.

**Audit:** Confirmation emails are logged to the `Email log` sheet.

---

### 5. Stripe Payment Receipt

**Trigger:** Stripe Checkout — Re:Member passes `receipt_email` in the Checkout Session API call, which overrides Dashboard automatic receipt settings. Stripe sends its own branded receipt directly to the applicant.

- **With `receipt_email` in the API call:** Stripe sends a receipt to that specific address regardless of Dashboard settings
- **Without `receipt_email`:** Stripe uses the Dashboard setting (automatic receipts on/off)

---

## Email Infrastructure

**Module:** `src/lib/email-sender.ts`

### Provider: Mailgun (HTTP API via `mailgun.js`)

### Configuration

```env
MAILGUN_API_KEY=key-...
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=mg.example.com
MAILGUN_FROM=Re:Member Membership Notifications <no-reply@mg.example.com>
```

`MAILGUN_FROM` should be a recognisable brand name, not "No Reply" or
"noreply" — generic From names are penalised by iCloud/Apple spam
classifiers and the message lands in Junk even with DKIM/SPF/DMARC
all passing. See `docs/runbooks/mailgun-setup.md` §7 for the full
deliverability note (first-send reputation, `List-Unsubscribe`
header, recipient training).

### Audit Logging

All outgoing emails are logged to the `Email log` tab in the same spreadsheet that holds application data. The sheet has 7 columns:

| Column | Content |
|---|---|
| A | timestamp (ISO 8601) |
| B | to (recipient email) |
| C | subject |
| D | template (one of: `confirmation`, `associate_confirmation`, `application_notification`, `resume_link`) |
| E | applicantId (or associateApplicationId) |
| F | result (`sent` or `failed`) |
| G | error (present only when result is `failed`) |

Logging is best-effort — Gmail send completes before the sheet write is attempted. If the audit write fails, the error is re-thrown to the caller (for logging purposes), but the email itself has already been sent.

## Related: Google Docs (Post-Payment)

After successful payment, a **Google Document** is created for internal review (not sent to applicant):

- `createApplicationReviewDoc()` — Professional membership (`stripe-webhook.ts`)
- `createAssociateApplicationReviewDoc()` — Associate membership (`stripe-webhook.ts`)

Documents are saved to `GOOGLE_DRIVE_REVIEW_DOCS_FOLDER_ID` (falls back to `GOOGLE_DRIVE_APPLICATIONS_FOLDER_ID`).

---

## Adding a New Notification

### 1. Define the trigger

Decide **when** the notification should fire (form submission, payment, status change, etc.).

### 2. Choose the channel

- **Email:** Use `sendEmail()` from `src/lib/email-sender.ts`
- **Google Doc:** Use `createApplicationReviewDoc()` pattern from `src/lib/google-docs.ts`

### 3. Implement

```typescript
import { sendEmail } from '@/lib/email-sender';

// In your handler:
await sendEmail({
  to: applicant.email,
  subject: 'Your Re:Member Application - Next Steps',
  body: `Dear ${applicant.firstName},\n\n...`,
});
```

### 4. Document it

Add the notification type to the table above with:
- Trigger condition
- UI location where it is promised (if applicable)
- Implementation file

### 5. Non-blocking rule

Email failures should be logged but not fail the parent operation:

```typescript
try {
  await sendEmail({ ... });
} catch (err) {
  logger.error({ err, applicantId }, 'Failed to send notification email');
}
```
