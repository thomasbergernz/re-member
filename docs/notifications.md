# ELDAA Notifications

> When and how ELDAA sends notifications to applicants and members.

---

## Currently Implemented

### 1. Resume Link Email

**Trigger:** New Professional Membership application started (`POST /api/professional/apply`)

**Conditions:**
- Only on **new** applicant creation (not on subsequent form updates/resumes)
- Applicant must have provided an email address

**Template:** `sendResumeLink(toEmail, fullName, resumeLink)` in `src/lib/email-sender.ts`

```
Subject: Your ELDAA Professional Membership Application

Dear {fullName},

Thank you for starting your Professional Membership application with ELDAA.

To continue your application, please click the link below:
{resumeLink}

This link will allow you to upload your required documents and complete your application.

If you did not start this application, please ignore this email.

Best regards,
ELDAA
```

**Delivery:** Non-blocking — failures are logged but do not fail the application submission.

## Planned / Not Yet Implemented

The following notifications are described in the UI but **not yet implemented**:

| Notification | UI Copy | Trigger Location | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Document verification confirmation | "You will receive confirmation once your documents have been verified" | `success-upload.astro` | Not implemented |
| Membership activation confirmation | "You will receive confirmation once your membership has been activated" | `associate-membership.astro` | Not implemented |
| Payment receipt | — | — | **Stripe handles it** — ELDAA passes `receipt_email` in the Checkout Session API call, which overrides Dashboard automatic receipt settings. Stripe sends its own branded receipt directly to that address. |
| Subscription renewal reminder | — | — | Not implemented |
| Application review completion | — | — | Not implemented |

### 2. Payment Confirmation (Applicant Email)

**Trigger:** `checkout.session.completed` webhook event for professional membership

**To:** Applicant's email address (from sheet)

**Template:** `sendProfessionalConfirmation(toEmail, fullName)` in `src/lib/email-sender.ts`

```
Subject: Your ELDAA Professional Membership Application

Dear {fullName},

Thank you for your application to become a Professional Member of ELDAA. We will process your application and get back to you as soon as we can.

We look forward to seeing you soon.

Kia ora,
ELDAA Committee
```

**Delivery:** Non-blocking — failures are logged but do not fail webhook processing.

---

### 3. Internal Application Notification (ELDAA Membership Team)

**Trigger:** After `createApplicationReviewDoc()` completes successfully for professional membership

**To:** `membership@eldaa.org.nz` (hardcoded)

**Template:** `sendProfessionalApplicationNotification(toEmail, applicantName, docUrl)` in `src/lib/email-sender.ts`

```
Subject: New Professional Membership Application — {applicantName}

A new professional membership application has been received and the review document is ready.

Applicant: {applicantName}
Review document: {docUrl}

Please log in to review the application and continue the membership process.

ELDAA
```

**Delivery:** Non-blocking — failures are logged but do not fail webhook processing.

---

### 4. Stripe Payment Receipt

**Trigger:** Stripe Checkout — ELDAA passes `receipt_email` in the Checkout Session API call, which overrides Dashboard automatic receipt settings. Stripe sends its own branded receipt directly to the applicant.

- **With `receipt_email` in the API call:** Stripe sends a receipt to that specific address regardless of Dashboard settings
- **Without `receipt_email`:** Stripe uses the Dashboard setting (automatic receipts on/off)

---

## Email Infrastructure

**Module:** `src/lib/email-sender.ts`

### Authentication (in order of preference)

1. **Gmail OAuth2** (primary)
   - `GMAIL_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
   - `GMAIL_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `GMAIL_OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN`

2. **Service Account** (fallback)
   - Uses `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` or workload identity

### Configuration

```env
GMAIL_SENDER_EMAIL=no-reply@eldaa.org.nz
```

---

## Related: Google Docs (Post-Payment)

After successful payment, a **Google Document** is created for internal review (not sent to applicant):

- `createApplicationReviewDoc()` — Professional membership (`stripe-webhook.ts`)
- `createAssociateApplicationReviewDoc()` — Associate membership (`stripe-webhook.ts`)

Documents are saved to `GOOGLE_DRIVE_REVIEW_DOCS_FOLDER_ID` (falls back to `GOOGLE_DRIVE_APPLICATIONS_FOLDER_ID`).

---

## Adding a New Notification

### 1. Define the trigger

Decide **when** the notification should fire (form submission, payment, status change, etc.).

### 2. Choose the channel

- **Email:** Use `sendEmail()` from `src/lib/email-sender.ts`
- **Google Doc:** Use `createApplicationReviewDoc()` pattern from `src/lib/google-docs.ts`

### 3. Implement

```typescript
import { sendEmail } from '@/lib/email-sender';

// In your handler:
await sendEmail({
  to: applicant.email,
  subject: 'Your ELDAA Application - Next Steps',
  body: `Dear ${applicant.firstName},\n\n...`,
});
```

### 4. Document it

Add the notification type to the table above with:
- Trigger condition
- UI location where it is promised (if applicable)
- Implementation file

### 5. Non-blocking rule

Email failures should be logged but not fail the parent operation:

```typescript
try {
  await sendEmail({ ... });
} catch (err) {
  logger.error({ err, applicantId }, 'Failed to send notification email');
}
```
